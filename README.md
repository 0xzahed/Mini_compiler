# 🛠️ Mini Compiler

A simple arithmetic expression compiler built using **Lex** and **Yacc** in **C**. This project performs lexical analysis and syntax parsing for basic arithmetic operations.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

Mini\_compiler/
├── calc.l         # Lex specification file
├── calc.y         # Yacc grammar file
├── calc.tab.c     # Generated parser code
├── calc.tab.h     # Generated parser header
├── lex.yy.c       # Generated scanner code
├── input.txt      # Sample input expressions

````

## ⚙️ Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes input expressions using `calc.l`.
- **Syntax Analysis**: Parses tokens based on grammar rules in `calc.y`.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and reports syntax errors in expressions.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flex**: Fast lexical analyzer generator
- **Bison**: Parser generator (GNU version of Yacc)
- **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection

## 🛠️ Compilation & Execution

1. **Generate the parser and scanner:**

   ```bash
   bison -d calc.y
   flex calc.l
   gcc -o calc calc.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl
````

2. **Run the compiler with sample input:**

   ```bash
   ./calc < input.txt
   ```

   Replace `input.txt` with your own file to test different expressions.

## 📝 Sample Input (`input.txt`)

```
3 + 4 * 5
(10 - 2) / 4
7 * (8 + 2)
```
